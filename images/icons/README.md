This directory should contain the following PWA icons:

- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels (required)
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels (required)

## Generating Icons

You can create these icons using various tools:
- Online generators (search "PWA icon generator")
- Image editing software
- Design tools like Figma, Canva, etc.

## Requirements

- PNG format
- Square aspect ratio
- Icon should work as "any maskable" (important elements in center safe zone)
- Square icons with rounded corners will be automatically masked on some platforms

For now, create simple colored squares as placeholders:
- Blue square 192x192px
- Blue square 512x512px
